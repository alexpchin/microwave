  Microwave was a boutique London-based web-design and development agency setup by <a href="http://www.alexchin.co.uk" title="Alex Chin">Alex Chin</a>, <a href="http://problemsolvedux.com/" title="Andrew Wills">Andrew Wills</a> and <a href="http://fa-designer.com/" title="Fernando Amschlinger">Fernando Amschlinger</a>.

We worked on some really great projects with some fantastic clients including making the first website for "The New Choo" [Beatrix Ong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatrix_Ong), helping [Cafe Mambo Ibiza](http://www.cafemamboibiza.com/) launch their social media profiles (which now have over 300,000 fans and followers), helping [Jade Jagger](http://jadejagger.co.uk/) to make more friends on Facebook, building websites for [University of the Arts London](http://www.arts.ac.uk/), [The Hepatitis C Trust](http://www.hepctrust.org.uk/) and creating innovative new platforms like [Ibiza Vote](http://www.ibizavote.com).

The Microwave team has now moved on to bigger and better things, perhaps not forever but certainly for the near future. 

Here is a little update with what we are all up to:

### Alex

* Attended [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/london) and is now a full stack web developer.
* Started [Womapp.com](http://www.womapp.com) a social shopping website with over 3.5million products.


### Andrew

* Took a job as Head of User Experience at [Elvis](http://www.elviscommunications.com/) where he worked with clients like Sky, Honda Motor Europe, Premier Foods, Yakult, Virgin Holidays, Auto Trader, Virgin Trains, Vodafone, Sailor Jerry, Bacardi, Dr Oetker, Cadbury. Phew!
* Ran a marathon, visit his [marathon micro-site](http://www.challengeandi.com/).
* Got engaged to Kelly!

### Fernando

* Fernando has now moved back to Brazil where he setup [AgÃªncia Alive](http://agenciaalive.com/).

Thanks to all our clients and friends who made setting up Microwave such fun! With a special thanks to the Peppe family for letting us [stay in Ibiza](http://www.ibizavillas2000.com/) whenever we needed!
